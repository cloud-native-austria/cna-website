## Adding a new chapter/meetup

### Chapter

Adding a new chapter consists of 2 parts

- Adding a logo

    Add a new logo file to the '/cna/static/img' folder with the following naming convention:

    > YOURCHAPTERNAME.png

    e.g.

    > graz.png

- Adding your page

    Under '/cna/src/pages' add a new folder named after your chapter. The path then would look like this...

    > /cna/src/pages/graz

    Within this folder you copy the template index.js from the template folder.
    Then you need to create a description mdx file descriping your chapter - use the template or be creative :).

    Adding new meetup dates and information for those events is discussed in the next section.

    If you did everything right your chapter should be shown on the homepage alongside the others and, if you added  meetup(s) already, the next upcoming meetup if there is one.

### Meetup

If you have your chapter already created, adding a new meetup is as simple as adding a new mdx file to your chapter folder withing /src/pages/YOUR-CHAPTER following this naming convention:

> YYYYMMDD.mdx

|Convention|Explanation
|-|-
|YYYY|The year the meetup will take place e.g. "2024"
|MM|The month the meetup will take place e.g. "02" for february
|DD|The day of the month the meetup will take place e.g. "04"

So the file from the explanations above would be named like this.

> 20240204.mdx

If you follow this convention the date is read and shown in your description of your location as one of the meetup dates.
Moreover if it is the next meetup happenig it will be automatically shown on the start page as the next meetup of your chapter.
Make sure to provide all the necessary information as a front matter block in the mdx file.
This will look something like..
