# Graz

## History

The journey of the CNCF Community Chapter Graz is like a well-coded script that's come to life, evolving from its initial commit in winter 2020 to a feature-rich community project by mid-2022. Let's debug the timeline and see how this awesome group bootstrapped itself into existence.

- Winter 2020: Picture this: the early lines of code (well, ideas really) were written by Daniel Drack, diving deep into the world of master thesis expert interviews. Little did he know, he was laying down the foundation of what would become a thriving community.

- 8th July 2021: Fast forward to a sunny day in July, a bunch of tech enthusiasts (and previously interviewed experts) converged at Continuum Graz. Amid discussions, coffee, and probably a few Kubernetes jokes, an epic idea spawned – why not start a Kubernetes regulars' table? And just like that, a new branch was created in the story.

- 1st October 2021: The first in-person Kubernetes regulars' table was set up at Technopark Raaba, marking the official launch of what would be a series of epic gatherings. The group also went digital, setting up camp on Meetup.com to rally the troops for future events.

- 24th November 2021 & 23rd February 2022: The community didn't let something as trivial as physical distance slow them down. They went online, hosting Kubernetes tables that probably felt like the coolest remote pods ever spun up. These sessions not only kept the spirit alive but also doubled down on their commitment to sharing knowledge.

- 23rd February 2022: The plot thickens! The group merged with the Infrastructure as Code Graz group on Meetup.com, essentially doing a mega merge of communities. Now, that's how you scale!

- 27th June 2022: Achievement unlocked – the group leveled up to an official CNCF Community Group, hosting its debut CNCF Community Graz meetup. This wasn't just any milestone; it was a testament to their passion and dedication to the cloud-native universe.

- Post-June 2022: From there, it's been a non-stop adventure with 14 meetups, drawing crowds of 10 to 30 people. We're talking top-tier speakers, a Christmas party that was probably more fun than debugging code on a Friday night, nerdy pub quizzes that tested your tech trivia, and even playing a pivotal role in Austria's first Kubernetes Community Days. Now, that's what you call a full-stack community experience!

So there you have it, the CNCF Community Chapter Graz's journey from a fledgling idea to a powerhouse of cloud-native enthusiasts. It's been a path filled with learning, sharing, and quite a bit of fun – proving that when techies come together, awesome things happen. Here's to more commits, meetups, and cloud-native adventures ahead!
