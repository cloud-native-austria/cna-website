# Vienna

Cloud Native Computing is on everyone's mind!
This, and the sheer size of the city of Vienna, is the reason for supporting multiple meetups and communities in Vienna.
These communities in Vienna are supported and/or endorsed by Cloud Native Austria:

- [Cloud Native Vienna](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-vienna/)
- [Vienna DevOps & Security Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/vienna-devops-security/)

As always with meetups, everyone's welcome.
