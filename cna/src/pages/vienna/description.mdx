Supported Community: Cloud Native Austria members.

:::

Cloud Native Computing is on everyone's mind. In this meetup series we will:

- Look at new ways to provision and utilize on- and off-premise clouds
- Exchange best-practices and pitfalls
- Look at Cloud Native Computing and Cloud Native Application Development from a devop's, developer's and operator's perspective.

As always with meetups, everyone's welcome. If you want to present something yourself, fill out this form or  contact us via meetup.com or mail.

More information regarding Cloud Native Computing:

Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.
These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects.
We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone.
