From Manifests to the OAM - Defining Services in Kubernetes - Thomas Schütz (karriere.at)

Deploying microservices on Kubernetes can be challenging, with countless tools and frameworks promising to simplify the process. But how do you choose the right approach for your needs?
In this talk, you’ll explore various methods for defining and deploying services in Kubernetes, from simple manifest-based setups to advanced tools like Operators, the Open Application Model (OAM), and KubeVela. I’ll also share real-world experiences with templating tools and application definitions to help you navigate these options effectively.
By the end of the session, you’ll gain a comprehensive overview of the technologies available to streamline and optimize Kubernetes deployments.
Thomas is a Senior Enterprise Architect at karriere.at and a passionate advocate for cloud-native technology, platform engineering, and efficient application delivery. He focuses on enhancing application delivery processes and continuously explores innovative methods to optimize development experience.
As an educator Thomas shares his expertise through academic teaching on Cloud Native Technologies, empowering the next generation of engineers. With a blend of practical experience and thought leadership, he is dedicated to advancing modern software delivery practices.

Multitenancy in the Kubernetes Era - Hrittik Roy (Loft Labs)

Multitenancy is the ability to share a cluster between multiple tenants, which is an exciting concept. It involves starting with a single cluster and then allowing multiple teams to share it. This approach can be particularly useful for enterprises that want to optimize their resource utilization and reduce operational costs as well as complexity while increasing agility and collaboration. However, security and isolation can still be challenging issues that need to be addressed.
This talk focuses on all the aspects that you need to know about Multitenancy before successful adoption. Starting from the basics, this talk ends on how solutions like vCluster (https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/) can help your multitenancy strategy.
Hrittik is currently Platform Advocate at Loft Labs and a CNCF Ambassador, who has previously worked at various startups helping them scale their content efforts. He loves diving deep into distributed systems and creating articles on them and has spoken at conferences such as Azure Cloud Summit, UbuCon Asia and Kubernetes Community Days - Lagos and Chennai among others! His best days are when he finds ways to create impact in the communities he’s a part of either by code, content, or mentorship!
