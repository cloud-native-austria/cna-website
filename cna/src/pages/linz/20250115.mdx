## Topics

We are excited to announce the January/2025 edition of the Cloud Native Linz meetup!
We'd like to thank Public Cloud Group for hosting the Meetup!

--------- The Speakers ---------

Sophia Zehethofer

Coming from a Software Engineering background, Sophia found her passion for automating the deployment of cloud infrastructure.
She enjoys helping developers to get their software in the hands of customers by providing secure, scalable and developer-friendly platforms for them to use.
With a broad understanding of the whole software development process from UX research to infrastructure operations, she helps to bring together different people to streamline development processes, before automating them.

Patrick Pichler

Patrick Pichler is a Senior Software Engineer at CastAI, a leading player in the Kubernetes Autoscaling Space, that recently also ventured in the world of Kubernetes Security.
He works on building an Kuberenetes Runtime Security product, that detects anomalies in your workloads through the power of eBPF.
Prior to working at CastAI, he was an Cloud Security engineer at Dynatrace.
Outside of work, Patrick enjoys torturing himself in Triathlon Training.

--------- The Talks ---------

Sophia Zehethofer - Containerized Builds: A closer look at Docker BuildKit and Buildx

Most of us use Dockerfiles with docker build to create container images, but they are more powerful than you might think at first.
For example, did you know, that `docker build` can output files instead of images?
In this talk, we explore, how to use Docker BuildKit and Buildx to containerize our whole build, test and deployment environment - on the dev machine and on the CI server.
We will also learn how to use layers and mounting to speed up and secure the builds.

Patrick Pichler - Beesting - Can't touch this

Join me on a journey from a random idea of using eBPF to monitor for malicious file accesses in Kubernetes Pods, to a PoC level project called Beesting.
The talk will leave you with a better understanding of different low level components that run on a Kubernetes node.
You will also learn about the various options I considered, as well as the trade-offs I had to take.
On top of that, you get a front-row seat for seeing the power of eBPF in action.
