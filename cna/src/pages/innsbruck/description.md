# Innsbruck

We aim to create a space for the cloud-native community in Innsbruck to get together and share their knowledge and enthusiasm for cloud-native technologies, Kubernetes, DevOps, and Platform Engineering.

For this we host events to connect the ever-growing group of people and companies that are working on and with cloud-native software in and around Innsbruck!

## Where can we be found?
