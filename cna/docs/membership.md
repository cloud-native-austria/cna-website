# Becoming a member of Cloud Native Austria

Cloud Native Austria is all about building and fostering communities.

Our goal is to improve the cloud native ecosystem in Austria, by building stronger and more active communities.
By becoming a member of Cloud Native Austria, you take an active step towards this goal.
Your membership and contribution will not only help the Austrian community, but will help your local community even more.
Since we regard a membership as a token of commitment to strengthening your local community, we will double down on that.
Each member of your local community, that is becoming a member of Cloud Native Austria, will increase the benefits you'll get out of the membership as a community.

A modest annual membership fee of €50 per person unlocks several exciting benefits:

- Each community receives €100 support per year, intended for marketing and management expenses
- Each member receives a discounted ticket for KCD Austria.
- A Cloud Native Austria member in a community is granted €100 annually to support community events, fostering growth and engagement.
  - This incentive is limited to three members per community.
- A unique Cloud Native community-specific email address is issued.
- The community gains visibility by being listed on the Cloud Native Austria website.
- Each member can use Cloud Native Austria resources (meetup.com, LinkedIn,..) to organise local events in Austria
- Members are warmly invited to the annual general meeting, a great chance to have a say in the community’s direction.

Beware, the financial support is taken from a joint budget pot.
The amount of the budget pot is decided each year.
Increases are possible. Payments are made on a first come, first serve basis.
